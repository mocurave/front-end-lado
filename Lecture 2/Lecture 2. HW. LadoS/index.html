            There is a house way down in New Orleans<br>
            They call the Rising Sun<br>
            And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
            And God I know I'm one
            Mother was a tailor, yeah, yeah
            Sewed my Levi jeans
            My father was a gamblin' man, yeah, yeah
            Down, way down in New Orleans
